              Like any other software engineer's story, Iâ€™m not someone who
              found their love for coding during high school or built my first
              app when I was a kid. My journey to software began when I was
              working as a technical support engineer back in 2017 (fun fact: my
              first job in Engineering). I was still in my sixth semester at{' '}
              <a href="https://unapec.edu.do/" target="_blank">
                univeristy
              </a>{' '}
              and six months from graduation.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my first experience in the IT world, I met a senior
              engineer who was working in the same company but in the
              development team. He introduced me to the world of software, and I
              instantly fell in love. In the following days, I invested my free
              time in building side projects. These were very beginner projects
              like CRUD apps, how to connect to a DB, etc. They were probably
              not the best projects, but helped me a lot to get a general idea
              of how to build software. I spent almost a month building projects
              until I found a job posting from this{' '}

                public institution
              </a>{' '}
              looking for a software engineer. TL;DR: I applied and got the job,
              yay! ðŸ˜ƒ And thatâ€™s how I landed my first software engineering job.

              Two and a half years passed, and it got to a point where I wanted
              to find more challenging projects. I had always dreamed of working
              at a company in the USA. While trying to enter the US market, I
              found a part-time role at an agency in Miami. They had
              partnerships with multiple small companies across the country and
              were helping them build internal apps for their clients. I had the
              opportunity to talk with customers, discuss their problems, and
              then go back to the team to design solutions.

              In March 2020, I met Pinwheel, and it changed my life. I joined as
              one of the first engineers and learned what it takes to build a
              company from the ground up. I helped build most of the services that powers the company today. 
              Before Pinwheel, I had some experience in the software world, but Pinwheel really
              matured me. During my time at Pinwheel, Iâ€™ve met awesome engineers
              who have taught me how to build scalable systems and how to grow
              in my career as a software engineer.
